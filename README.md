# Financial Calculations

## Description
This Python script performs two essential financial calculations:
1. **Future Investment Value Calculation** - Computes the future value of an investment based on a given principal, annual interest rate, and number of years.
2. **Gratuity and Total Bill Calculation** - Computes gratuity and total bill amount based on a given subtotal and gratuity percentage.

This project is valuable for learning about financial computations and is relevant to a **Software Development Apprentice** role.

## Features
- Computes **compound interest** for investment growth.
- Calculates **gratuity and total bill amount**.
- Accepts **user input dynamically**.
- Implements **error handling** for invalid inputs.
- Provides a **menu-driven interface** for usability.

## How to Use
1. Run the script using Python.
2. Choose an option from the menu:
   - `1`: Calculate Future Investment Value.
   - `2`: Calculate Gratuity and Total Bill.
   - `3`: Exit the program.
3. Follow the on-screen instructions to enter the required values.

## Installation
1. Clone this repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/financial_calculations.git
   ```
2. Navigate to the project folder:
   ```bash
   cd financial_calculations
   ```
3. Run the script:
   ```bash
   python financial_calculations.py
   ```

## Future Enhancements
- Add **currency formatting** based on user location.
- Implement a **graphical user interface (GUI)** using Tkinter.
- Expand the script to include **loan calculations**.

## Relevance to Software Development Apprenticeship
- Demonstrates **Python scripting and user input handling**.
- Enhances **problem-solving skills** through financial computations.
- Implements **clean coding practices and modular functions**.
